    <h3>About react native:</h3>
    <h5>The engineers at facebook designed a new language
    
    called "JSX" and a library for jsx called "React native"
    <br>
    to easily work on their facebook mobile apps.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    JSX is a combination of html and javaScript method of coding.

        <h3>Components:</h3>
       <h5> In react native the components always start from uppercase letters.
           <br>
    <br>
        Component is the base class from which all other components are from.
        <br>

    <div class="app">
        <h3>App:</h3>
        <h5>
            A function called render() is used in the App component.
            this function displays the things returned by it.
            <br>
            the render function is the only function in app component which doesn't
            <br>
           have
            javaScript.
            <br>
            <br>
            In JSX we can use javaScript inside the flower brackets.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the some components we can see two flower brackets.
            one inside another{{}};
            <br>
            the first one is to address that we are using javaScript and 
            <br>
            the second one is for using it;
            <br>
            <br>
            some components have properties such as: style.
